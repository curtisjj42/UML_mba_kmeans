# Clustering and MBA Analysis

Code and responses for Unsupervised Machine Learning Midterm exam

## Description

This project involves two key analyses: k-means clustering on a database of unspecified measurements and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) on a transactional database of stock closing prices. The k-means clustering aims to uncover patterns and groupings within the measurement data, helping to identify distinct clusters for further investigation. The MBA analysis applies association rule mining techniques to stock transaction data, examining relationships between stock closing prices and identifying patterns in stock price movements. Together, these analyses explore best practices for predictive modeling by assessing the effectiveness of clustering and rule mining in uncovering actionable insights for decision-making.
